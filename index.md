I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in partial differential equations and their applications at Queen's University. Previously, I graduated with a PhD in mathematics under the supervision of [Catherine Sulem](https://www.math.toronto.edu/sulem/) and [Bob Haslhofer](https://www.math.toronto.edu/roberth/) at the University of Toronto in 2023.
